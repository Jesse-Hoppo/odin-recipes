        <h3> A beautifully cooked Sesame Chicken </h3>
            <p> The <strong> BEST </strong> Sesame Chicken in Australia. Beautifully cooked and finished to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters.</p>

            <p> 
                The meal consists of pieces or strips of chicken stir-fried in an oyster 
                sauce with ginger and garlic till cooked through. Green onions, sliced, are also used to round off this delicious supper. 
                Some versions of Sesame Chicken come with rice or noodles, while others utilize carrots instead of chicken as the main element.
